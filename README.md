# fnfauto
A bot to play the game Friday Night Funkin

~~The java bot is basically better in every way, but I put the python bot as well because why not~~

The python version of the bot is very effective, if you want you can run the java version but it wont be as good.

**How to run:**

Python:
cd into the directory that the file is in with cmd and run:

"python fnf-test.py"

Java:
cd into the directory that the file is in with cmd and run:

"javac fnftest.java"

"java fnftest"

**How to line up the arrows:**

The bot will scan for the location of the arrows on the itch.io page, if you are running the game as an exe or ar running mods just resize the window to fit the window on the itch.io page.
